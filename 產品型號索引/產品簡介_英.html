	52V/600mA, 1.25MHz/550kHz
Asynchronous Step Down Converter</p>
<p class="TextContent">
	The HT7463A/B is a current mode buck converter.
With a wide input range from 4.5V to 52V,
the HT7463A/B is suitable for a wide range of
applications such as power conditioning from
unregulated sources. Having a low internal switch
typical RDSON value of 0.9Ω, the device has a good
operating typical efficiency value of 85% and the
added advantage of reduced junction temperature.</p>
<p class="TextContent">
The operating frequency is fixed at 1250/550kHz for
the HT7463A/HT7463B respectively. The HT7463A
allows the use of small external components while
still being able to have low output voltage ripple.
A soft-start function can be implemented using the
enable pin and by connecting an external RC circuit
allowing the user to tailor the soft-start time to a
specific application. </p>

	High Current and Performance White LED Driver</p>
<p class="TextContent">
The HT7939 is a high efficiency boost converter for driving
White LEDs using current mode operation. The device
is designed to drive up to 39 White LEDs from a 5V
power supply. The White LED current is setup using an
external current setting resistor, which has a low feedback
voltage of 0.2V to minimise power losses in the resistor
which improves efficiency. The Over-voltage
function prevents damage to the IC by turning off the
converter when the LED load is open circuit.

	White LED Step-up Charge Pump Converter</p>
<p class="TextContent">
	The HT7936A and HT7936B are charge-pump type
DC-DC step-up converter devices, which can generate
regulated fixed output voltages of 5.0V and 4.5V. Their
high degree of functional integration requires only the
addition of three external capacitors, namely a flying capacitor
and an input and output capacitor, to implement
a full step-up conversion function.</p>
<p class="TextContent">
	The devices have the additional benefit of an integrated
soft start function to reduce the level of in-rush current
during device power on. The operating voltage range is
from 2.8V to the full output voltage value, V<sub>OUT</sub>.</p>
<p class="TextContent">
	To meet the demands of todays power sensitive applications,
the devices, have a very low standby current
value as well as the extra safety features of current limit
and short circuit protection. This range of device features,
supplied in 6-pin SOT-23-6 package type, will ensure
that these device will find excellent use in a wide
range of DC-DC step-up converter applications.</p>

	100mA PFM Synchronous
Step-up DC/DC Converter</p>
<p class="TextContent">
	The HT77xxS devices are a high efficiency PFM synchronous
step-up DC-DC converter series which are
designed to operate with both wire wound chip power
inductors and also with multi-layered chip power
inductors. The device series have the advantages of
extremely low start-up voltage as well as high output
voltage accuracy. Being manufactured using CMOS
technology ensures ultra low supply current. Because
of their higher operating frequency, up to 500 kHz,
the devices have the benefits of requiring smaller outline
type lower value external inductors and capacitors.
The higher operating frequency also offers the
advantages of much reduced audio frequency noise.
The devices require only three external components
to provide a fixed output voltage of 1.8V, 2.2V, 2.7V,
3.0V, 3.3V, 3.7V or 5.0V.</p>
<p class="TextContent">
	The HT77xxS devices include an internal oscillator,
PFM control circuit, driver transistor, reference voltage
unit and a high speed comparator. They employ
pulse frequency modulation techniques, to obtain
minimum supply current and ripple at light output
loading. These devices are available in space saving
TO92, SOT89, SOT23 and SOT23-5 packages. For
SOT23-5 package types, they also include an internal
chip enable function to reduce power consumption
when in the shutdown mode.</p>
